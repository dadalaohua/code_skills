/* loom_task, with an added mark field. This is used mark whether a task is
 * ready to have the l->commit or l->done offsets advanced over it.
 *
 * . The mark bytes are all memset to 0xFF at init.
 * 
 * . The l->write offset can only advance across a cell if its mark
 *   has the most significant bit set.
 *    
 * . When a cell has been reserved for write (by atomically CAS-ing
 *   l->write to increment past it; during this time, only the producer
 *   thread reserving it can write to it), it is marked for commit by
 *   setting the mark to the write offset. Since the ring buffer wraps,
 *   this means the next time the same cell is used, the mark value will
 *   be based on the previous pass's write offset (l->write - l->size),
 *   which will no longer be valid.
 *
 * . After a write is committed, the producer thread does a CAS loop to
 *   advance l->commit over every marked cell. Since putting a task in
 *   or out of the queue is just a memcpy of an ltask to/from the
 *   caller's stack, it should never block for long, and have little
 *   variability in latency. It also doesn't matter which producer
 *   thread advances l->commit.
 *
 * . Similarly, a consumer atomically CASs l->read to reserve a cell
 *   for read, copies its task into its call stack, and then sets
 *   the cell mask to the negated read offset (~l->read). This means
 *   that it will always be distinct from the commit mark, distinct
 *   from the last spin around the ring buffer, and have the most
 *   significant bit set so that l->write knows it's free to advance
 *   over it.
 *
 * . Also, after the read is released, the consumer thread does a
 *   CAS loop to advance l->done over every marked cell. This behaves
 *   just like the CAS loop to advance l->commit above. */
