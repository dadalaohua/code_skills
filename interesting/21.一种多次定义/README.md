# tentative definition and definition

多次定义

### 1.

```
int i;
int i = 10;
```

Q: Is this code correct? (Will there occur an error related to the  fact that the variable is defined twice? Reminding you that it’s a  separate source file and not a part of the function body or compound  statement)

**Answer**

A: Yes, this code is correct. The first line is the tentative  definition that becomes the «definition» after the compiler processes  the definition (the second line).
